# Guidelines for Human and AI Contributors

## Welcome! ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘‹

Contributions from well-behaved humans and AI models are welcome. :)

## Core Principles

### 1. Usability and Accessibility First
Even though this is a CLI tool, we consider usability and accessibility carefully. Every interaction should be intuitive and inclusive.

### 2. Test-Driven Development
To aid the maintainability of the codebase, for every change, consider how it could be tested automatically. Update tests alongside your changes.

### 3. Documentation Consistency
Make sure README, code comments and CLI help are still accurate after your change. Documentation should reflect the current state of the code.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Write clear, maintainable code
- Include appropriate tests for new functionality
- Update documentation when making changes
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Consider the user experience in all changes

Thank you for helping make this project better!
